      I began coding at the age of 14, driven by my passion for gaming and curiosity 
      about how websites worked. Over the years, Iâ€™ve evolved into a 
      <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> who designs and builds 
      <strong>modern, high-performance applications</strong> for international clients.
    </p>

    <p>
      I specialize in <strong>Front-End development</strong> with <strong>React.js</strong>, 
      <strong>Next.js</strong>, and <strong>Vue.js</strong>, while also working on the 
      <strong>Back-End</strong> with <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Java</strong>. 
      Iâ€™ve deployed and maintained scalable systems on <strong>AWS</strong> and <strong>GCP</strong>, 
      collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver secure, data-driven solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™ve worked with leading brands like <strong>BBVA</strong>, <strong>Interbank</strong>, 
      and <strong>Supermercados Peruanos</strong>, building production-grade web and mobile platforms. 
      One of my milestones was <strong>developing an internal syllabus management system for UTP</strong>, 
      which is now in its second version. I also <strong>led the ERP system</strong> for 
      <em class="italic">Supermercados Peruanos</em>, managing the 
      <strong>migration of millions of records</strong> from Oracle to Google Cloud Platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      I take pride in writing <strong>clean, maintainable code</strong> and 
      applying <strong>Agile</strong> (Scrum / Kanban) practices to ensure efficient delivery. 
      My goal is to build software that creates real value for users and businesses â€” 
      <strong>letâ€™s build something great together! ðŸš€</strong>
